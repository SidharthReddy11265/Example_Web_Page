John Constantine (/ˈkɒnstənˌtaɪn/) is a fictional anti-superhero and mystic appearing in American comic books published by DC 
Comics and its alternative imprint Vertigo. The character first appeared in The Saga of Swamp Thing #37 (June 1985), and was 
created by Alan Moore, Rick Veitch, Steve Bissette, John Totleben, Jamie Delano and John Ridgway. He serves as the lead 
character of the comic books Hellblazer (1988–2013), Constantine (2013–2015), Constantine: The Hellblazer (2015–2016), and 
The Hellblazer (2016–2018).<br>

The titular Hellblazer,Constantine is a working class warlock, occult detective and con man stationed in London. He is known 
for his endless cynicism, deadpan snarking, ruthless cunning and constant chain smoking, but he's also a passionate humanitarian 
driven by a heartfelt desire to do some good in his life. Originally a supporting character who played a pivotal role in the "American 
Gothic" Swamp Thing storyline, Constantine received his own comic in 1988. The musician Sting was visual inspiration for the 
character.<br>

The Hellblazer series was the longest-running and most successful title of DC's Vertigo imprint.Empire ranked Constantine third 
in their 50 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time,while IGN ranked him No. 29 in their Top 100 Comic Book Heroes, and the 
character ranked No. 10 in Wizard's Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time. John Constantine made his first live appearance 
in the 2005 film Constantine by Keanu Reeves, and in the television series Constantine by Matt Ryan. Ryan returned to portray his 
role in the Arrowverse show Arrow in the fourth season, until joining the cast of the television series Legends of Tomorrow starting in 
the third season.
