<h1 style="text-align:center"><b>About DC</b></h1>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:18px;color:white;margin-top:100px;line-height:2;">
DC Comics, Inc. is an American comic book publisher. It is the publishing unit of DC Entertainment,a subsidiary of the Warner    
Bros. Global Brands and Experiences division of Warner Bros., a subsidiary of AT&T's WarnerMedia. DC Comics is one of the largest 
and oldest American comic book companies. The majority of its publications take place within the fictional DC Universe and feature 
numerous culturally iconic heroic characters, most notably Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and The Flash. The universe also 
features well-known supervillains who oppose the superheroes such as the Joker and Lex Luthor. The company has published non-DC 
Universe-related material, including Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Fables and many titles under their alternative imprint Vertigo.<br>

The initials "DC" came from the company's popular series Detective Comics, which featured Batman's debut and subsequently became 
part of the company's name.Originally in Manhattan at 432 Fourth Avenue, the DC Comics offices have been located at 480 and later 
575 Lexington Avenue; 909 Third Avenue; 75 Rockefeller Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC had its 
headquarters at 1700 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York City, however DC Entertainment relocated its headquarters from New 
York to Burbank, California in April 2015.<br>

Penguin Random House Publisher Services distributes DC Comics' books to the bookstore market,while Diamond Comic Distributors 
supplied the comics shop direct market until June 2020, where Lunar Distribution and UCS Comic Distributors, who already 
distributed to the direct market due to Diamond's distribution interruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, replaced Diamond to 
distribute to that market.DC Comics and its longtime major competitor Marvel Comics (acquired in 2009 by The Walt Disney 
Company, WarnerMedia's main competitor) together shared approximately 70% of the American comic book market in 2017,though 
this number may give a distorted view since graphic novels are excluded. With the sales of all books included, DC is the second biggest 
publisher, after Viz Media, and Marvel is third.
