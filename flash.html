Three men have held the title of "The Fastest Man Alive"—Jay Garrick, Barry 
Allen and Wally West. Each of them redefined the word "hero."<br>

The mysterious power known as the Speed Force is an energy field that has, 
over the centuries, granted incredible powers of velocity to certain heroes. The 
most famous of these is the Flash, also known as the Fastest Man Alive. Ever 
since the days of World War II, there has been a man clad in red who can run 
at impossible speeds, using his power to save lives and defend those who 
cannot defend themselves. All between the ticks of a second.<br>

In the 1940s, college student Jay Garrick acquired his super-speed abilities in a 
random lab accident and became the first DC Super Hero to go by the name 
the Flash. Years later, Jay was succeeded by police scientist Barry Allen, until 
Barry’s former kid partner Wally West took up the mantle at a time when Barry 
was considered dead. But, when Barry returned, he became the Flash once 
again. All three generations of speedsters have been cornerstone members of 
both the Justice Society and Justice League.<br>

The Flash has mastery over not just speed, but time itself, and he has often 
used his powers to travel though different eras and even into other dimensions. 
Although the Flash has not always been fast enough to outrun personal tragedy 
when it has come for him, he always does his best to prevent the same from 
happening to the people of Central City and Keystone City. In so doing, he's 
earned himself a spot among the greatest Super Heroes the DC Universe has 
ever known.
