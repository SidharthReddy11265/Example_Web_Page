<h2>Projects:</h2>
<p>08/2019–06/2020 <h2>Voice controlled personal assistant robot</h2></p>
<p>This project we are doing as a final year project. To build a Voice Controlled Personal<br>
Assistant Robot with a robotic arm, which obeys according to the user voice<br>
commands. The robot that can lift light weights for old people.The robot can perform<br>
different movements, turns, start/stop operations and relocate an object from one<br>
place to another.And we included Object detection to our robot.</p><br>
<span>2018</span> <span><h2>We Are At Your Disposal</h2></span>
<p>This is the title of my SSR(Student Social Responsibility) project which we have done in<br>
the month of June to make awareness of the villagers how to use plastic and our daily<br>
waste properly and plant more trees, we have done this camp in Visakhapatnam. The<br>
villagers who are present there were very helpful for us and also they were very<br>
responsive to what we are telling them and they promised us they will reduce the use<br>
of plastic and plant more trees in their area.<br>
<span><p>01/2018 – 03/2018</p><span> <span><h2>National Solar Vehicle Challenge</h2></span>
<p>It is a competition held by Dynamist motorsport, to make an efficient Solar vehicle<br>
according to the given specifications.<br>
We used a BLDC hub motor and also a Buck converter.<br>
Our vehicle stood fourth in the competition, we could make the vehicle less weight<br>
compared to the previous vehicle and also the converter which we have used is the<br>
most innovative idea and we are the only members to use such type of<br>
converter(Which was made by us).<br>
<p>2016 <h2>Fire Alarm</h2></p>
<p>I have done this project in my first year as a mini project for a lab, we have a simple fire<br>
alarm circuit using a thermistor that can sense fire which is in short-range to the device<br>
and an alarm as an indicator to the fire.</p><br>
<h2>Internship/In-plant Training:</h2>
<span>2018</span> <span><h2>Amara Raja Batteries Ltd</h2></span>
<p>This is a seven days Internship, To know how the Batteries (Lead-acid Batteries) are<br>
made, what are techniques used in the preparation and also what are the precautions<br>
they fallow while preparation, and also how the charging and discharging rate of the<br>
battery are calculated.<br>
<h2>Other Technical Interest</h2>
<p>programming in C ,C++ ,Python basic(received Certificate from HackerRank) , Html(no working<br>
experience), and MATLAB</p>
<h2>Awards:</h2>
<p>22/03/2018 <h2>National Solar Vehicle Challenge</h2></p>
<p>Dynamist Motor Sport<br>
It is a competition held by Dynamist motorsport, to make an efficient Solar vehicle<br>
according to the given specifications.<br>
The competition was held in Merchant University 18-22 March 2018 in Gujarat, And we<br>
stood “Fourth” place in that competition. We faced problems regarding brakes and the<br>
car was slowing down and finally stopped, Due to this we could not finish the final<br>
round and stood the 4th place.<br>

<p>10/06/2020 <h2>Voice Control Personal Assistant Robot For Elderly People</h2></p>
<p>5th International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems( ICCES 2020)<br>
held by IEEE<br>
Personal assistant robot helps to reduce the manual efforts being put by humans in<br>
their day-to-day tasks. This paper describes the designing and development of a<br>
Personal Assistant Robot that can be controlled by voice commands. The four-wheeled<br>
robot consists of a robotic arm for pick and place tasks. It can be widely used in many<br>
applications such as in chemical industries, helping old age disabled people and<br>
hospitals. The main aim of this project is to help old age or elderly people who face<br>
difficulty in day to day life.<br>
