Captain Marvel, also known as Shazam (/ʃəˈzæm/), is a fictional superhero appearing in American comics originally published by 
Fawcett Comics, and currently published by DC Comics. Artist C. C. Beck and writer Bill Parker created the character in 1939. 
Captain Marvel first appeared in Whiz Comics #2 (cover-dated Feb. 1940), published by Fawcett Comics. He is the alter ego of 
Billy Batson, a boy who, by speaking the magic word "SHAZAM!" (acronym of six "immortal elders": Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, 
Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury), can transform himself into a costumed adult with the powers of superhuman strength, speed, flight 
and other abilities. The character battles an extensive rogues' gallery, primarily archenemies Doctor Sivana, Black Adam, Mister 
Mind, and the Monster Society of Evil.<br>

Based on comic book sales, the character was the most popular superhero of the 1940s, outselling even Superman.Fawcett 
expanded the franchise to include other "Marvels", primarily Marvel Family associates Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr., who can 
harness powers similar to Billy's. Captain Marvel was also the first comic book superhero to be adapted into film, in a 1941 Republic 
Pictures serial, Adventures of Captain Marvel, with Tom Tyler as Captain Marvel and Frank Coghlan, Jr. as Billy Batson.<br>

Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel-related comics in 1953, partly because of a copyright infringement suit from DC Comics 
alleging that Captain Marvel was a copy of Superman.In 1972, Fawcett licensed the character rights to DC, which by 1991 
acquired all rights to the entire family of characters. DC has since integrated Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family into their DC 
Universe and has attempted to revive the property several times, with mixed success. Due to trademark conflicts over other 
characters named "Captain Marvel" owned by Marvel Comics,DC has branded and marketed the character using the trademark 
Shazam! since his 1972 reintroduction.This led many to assume that "Shazam!" was the character's name. DC renamed the 
mainline version of the character as "Shazam!" when relaunching its comic book properties in 2011,and his associates became 
the "Shazam Family".<br>

The character has been featured in two television series adaptations by Filmation: one live-action 1970s series with Jackson 
Bostwick and John Davey as Captain Marvel with Michael Gray as Billy Batson, and one animated 1980s series. The 2019 New 
Line Cinema/Warner Bros. film Shazam! is part of the DC Extended Universe, with Zachary Levi portraying the title role and Asher 
Angel as Billy Batson. Levi and Angel are set to return in a sequel to the film.<br>

The character was ranked as the 55th-greatest comic book character of all time by Wizard magazine.IGN also ranked Captain 
Marvel as the 50th-greatest comic book hero of all time, stating that the character will always be an enduring reminder of a simpler 
time.UGO Networks ranked him as one of the top heroes of entertainment, saying, "At his best, Shazam has always been 
compared to Superman with a sense of crazy, goofy fun."
